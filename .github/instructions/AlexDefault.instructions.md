Use JSDoc at all times to define types for all code

Use standard NextJS file structure

Avoid using shorthand in file, var, arguent, and function names. I should be able to tell what something is for via the name

Avoid comments execpt thoes used for JSDoc

Design all features to be scaleable, secure and fast

Use the absolute path for all import statements (insead of ../../../someModule use @/someModule)
